  "Helper macro to define states for the machine of type `machine-type'.

The generated state methods will be specialized on `machine-type' and
`state-name', and subclasses of `standard-state-machine' should use
this property to extend the state machine.

`state-name' is the identifier for this state, and names it. Event
invocations will use this name to determine which state the machine is
in, and error out if one cannot be found.  The event will be bound to
the symbol named `event-sym' declared as in a two-argument lambda
list.  Each invocation of this state with the even bound to
`event-sym' will evaluate `body' forms as in a method invocation and
the resulting value of the evaluation should return the next state for
the machine as a `:keyword', or `nil' to indicate the machine should
remain in its current state.  The symbol named by `machine-sym' will
be bound to the currently executing state machine.  The current state
is available in `state', though should be accessed as \"(state
machine-sym)\"

If the state produces two-value return, it is interpreted as (values
next-state recur-event) and if recur-event is non-nil the same event
is sent into the machine again after performing the transition into
next-state. This is useful if simply performing a state transition
would result in event starvation."
